# JSON Resume

Inspired by [JSON Resume](https://github.com/jsonresume)

## Tech

* React JS
* Node JS
* Webpack

## How to run

### Development

Install dependencies 
```bash 
yarn install
```

Run project
```bash 
yarn start
```

Deploy 
```bash 
yarn deploy
```


Todo:
* Add tests and coverage
* Buy a cheap domain (currently exploiting gh-pages repo name and master branch hack)
* Eject react scripts and strip out unwanted code.
